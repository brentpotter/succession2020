    <h2>Welcome to the Great Canadian Collaboration on Business Succession.</h2>

    <p>With 89.9% of the Canadian workforce employed by the SME sector, business continuation and therefore Boomer owner succession should be more important to this country than any other. The lack of a structured planning process has left 90% of SME owners in Canada, and indeed throughout all Boomer dominated economies, without a plan for succession or business continuation. Millions of jobs are at risk.</p>

    <p>Only business support providers, who care, can change this harsh reality. There is much that can be done to help create success in succession. If you care and qualify, maybe we can help you expedite and deliver a much needed structured planning effort that will have lasting impact on the economy.</p>

    <p>Success(ion) MMXX Inc. has dedicated over ten years to research and development of a completely new approach to bring objective focus to the wide-ranging obstacles to business succession. Our solution is designed to bring together experts willing to collaborate with others on a project by project basis. This unique approach introduces several innovations to help everyone involved:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SME owner education with the book <a href="succession2020-book.html">Success(ion) 2020 - NEW BEGINNINGS</a></li>
      <li>A unique approach to planning: TWMPP™, or the <a href="twmpp.html">Total Wealth Management Planning Process™</a></li>
      <li>New professional project manager style leadership to coordinate a collaboration of experts in each of the three different phases of business succession planning.</li>
      <li>An innovative financing alternative, <a href="incipient-financing.html">Incipient Financing™</a>: to address the challenges of new owner financing and monetizing SME owner equity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As one of a select few contributing Partners in the Process you can offer potential clients access to a professionally coordinated collaborative planning process, TWMPP™, the first ever to objectively:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Seek both visible and unseen obstacles to Success(ion)</li>
      <li>Assess and prioritize critical issues</li>
      <li>Provide situationally dependant access to a wide range of expert problem solvers</li>
      <li>Develop a customised solution for every client</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can introduce SME owners to a book that offers thousands of dollars’ worth of expert advice and perspective from many different sources and points of view. You know your clients better than anyone, and whether or not they could benefit from this kind of information. Your ability to distribute this educational text as a starting point for SME owner action will set you apart from your competition. It will present you as both a source of knowledge and a connection to a collaborative succession planning process. It will not be sold in stores.</p>

    <p>This book (and later a video series) will help qualify time-consuming early enquiry meetings, and eliminate valuable wasted hours on gathering basic information. Clients who buy, read the book, and return to engage the TWMPP™ program will separate themselves from those not ready.</p>

    <p>Better informed, with thousands of dollars’ worth of information, those who return will be committed to action. All you have to do then is refer them to a TWMPP™ Overall Project Coordinator, or OPC, who will lead the TWMPP™ assessment phase to save you even more low-level time involvement, until your expertise is required. This should let you focus your billable time on more highly valued expertise.</p>
