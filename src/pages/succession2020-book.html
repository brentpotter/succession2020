    <p>This book was written specifically for SME owners who desire new perspectives on how to create positive action to ultimately prepare, and possibly re-invent, both themselves and their business for their next phases of existence. This should be a focus on new beginnings by all concerned. There will be many obstacles, but understanding the more common ones should help.</p>

    <p>Finding a successor and monetizing business equity represent just the tip of an iceberg of a host of equally challenging subliminal “Soft Issues” that often create difficult obstacles to succession planning.</p>

    <p>Foremost among these, is the thought of leaving the centrepiece of most SME owners’ existence. Selling the business threatens a loss of identity, equating retirement to another form of death. That has translated into a subconscious Identity Crisis resulting in denial, and a refusal to initiate a planning effort for that feared outcome.</p>

    <p>Another major factor behind the SME sector’s lack of planning is the total failure of the SME business support provider community to deliver a truly holistic succession planning process. Too often, planning efforts promoted as holistic have a hidden agenda to help generate a product sale. (See e-Book Excerpts)</p>

    <p>By the year 2020, these critical issues will envelop 10 million SMEs employing 100 million workers in the English speaking developed world. In Canada, 65 - 70% of the 1.1 million SMEs that employ 89.9% of the total workforce indicate a need to sell the business to help finance retirement. Only 10% of SMEs have any sort of plan, 90% have none! What if 30%, 40%, or 50% of SME succession efforts fail?</p>

    <p>Continued denial and inaction will guarantee a future of failure and misery for many... but none of this has to be! Success(ion) 2020 - NEW BEGINNINGS offers new hope!</p>

    <p>This book contains interviews from 12 different experts who deliver thousands of dollars’ worth of perspective and advice gleaned from many years of experience in succession. They discuss the very issues SME owners typically ask about in their initial meetings. (See Table of Contents)</p>

    <p>Each Boomer transition into a different lifestyle phase caused major economic upheaval because those transitions were neither anticipated, nor understood, by those in charge. The final Boomer retirement phase may prove to be incredibly destructive to our entire socio-economic way of life, but no one in charge seems concerned. Major change looms ahead. It’s time for new thinking!</p>

    <p>Success(ion) 2020 NEW BEGINNINGS presents new thinking from cover to cover, outlining many challenges, but more importantly, presenting viable and practical solutions to help initiate critical SME succession planning. It introduces a unique approach to business succession planning, called the Total Wealth Management Planning Process™, or TWMPP™ created to transfer total entrepreneurial wealth in addition to monetizing business equity. A new Financing alternative called Incipient Financing™ will set new standards in multiple-owner SME succession financing.</p>
