    <p>For the experts in these various fields, past success involved cultivating a small network of clients and advisors that generated referrals. Future success will depend on how well these experts separate and qualify an overwhelming tsunami of early-stage Boomer SME owner enquiries.</p>
    <p>Demands for expert advice are increasing. Most experts say that they are keeping up for now, but cannot work any harder, and don’t know how they will handle the coming onslaught of demand. They signal growing frustration with the way the increase in business referrals interrupts their well-planned schedules.</p>
    <p>New referrals usually expect an immediate meeting. There is little choice, since the pipeline for future business must be kept full. Thus, schedules are disrupted and previously committed engagements impacted. These frustrations will continue to mount as the looming tidal wave of Boomer driven SME demand for succession/sale/exit advice intensifies.</p>
    <p>The first experts typically engaged for succession related advice suggest that most owners are starting their enquiries at the wrong end of the advisory chain, asking questions about where to begin. They also suggest that the majority of SME owners are not ready to begin planning for the future… because they are not willing to let go of the past. (See: SME Owners) </p>
    <p>With this current approach, everyone’s time is being wasted unnecessarily. If you are frustrated, think of how totally unprepared SME owners must feel trying to understand how, and if, the above spectrum of expertise can help them!</p>
    <p>If 90% of soon-to-retire SME owners have no business exit plans, and if those looking for direction don’t know where to start, then we must conclude that: 1) succession planning is not a do-it-yourself exercise, and 2) the existing approach has failed to deliver either leadership or appropriate answers to this SME succession dilemma.</p>
    <p>Boomer SME owners will need both, if their succession/sale/exit efforts are to be successful. Situational experts, unable to lead the entire succession planning exercise, will need a better way to participate in the planning effort. Is this possible? Yes, with new leadership… and a modified approach!</p>
