    <p>Originally designed for multi-owner incorporated SMEs, this program has been expanded to include company employed future owners, single buyers, or to help finance an MBO.</p>
    <p>The new owners will require financing, usually from multiple sources. Studies and experience suggest that the major sources tapped prior to approaching financial institutions will be family and the departing owner.</p>
    <p>Getting money from banks has never been easy, even for established companies. New unproven ownership adds new risk to further increase normal banker aversion for SME lending. Given the looming tectonic shift in selling activity, SME sellers should expect higher than normal vendor take-back (VTB) financing levels to form a part of future sale conditions. That will shift even more risk to sellers who become financiers without direct control. Future monetization payments that depend upon the continued success of the company will put more responsibility on the seller to ensure that success prior to the sale.</p>
    <p>Borrowing to buy a business puts increased stress on new owner mindsets and future cash flow. A traditional loan for $1,000,000 paid out to a seller can easily require $1.5 - $1.8 million in pre-tax revenue. Incipient Financing™ can potentially eliminate this issue altogether. While not for everyone, under the right circumstances, it can be up to 80% more cost effective and up to 40% more time efficient. Tested since 2003, this unique concept has already proven that it can generate sufficient funding for total monetization of equity prior to the departing owners exit-date.</p>
    <p>This program offers equal benefit to both sides of the business sale. Departing owners control the decisions affecting funding of the sale and can make their exit-timing decisions based upon availability of exit funding.</p>
    <p>The key to success of Incipient Financing™ is to start 4-6 years before the expected sale. That will require early planning.</p>
