    <p>Within the TWMPP™ concept, the succession planning exercise is separated into three separate phases, each with a distinctly different focus. Each requires different levels of expertise that might be called upon to lead the planning and execution stages. That, in turn, requires different levels of coordination for a planning project that may involve only one, two, or all three separate components. To that end, the overall scope of the planning engagement must be determined.</p>
    <p>Since every business, its owner(s), and its succession related issues are different, the entire spectrum of possibilities must be evaluated and put into perspective as a pre-planning exercise. Scope determination will allow a customized planning engagement proposal to be developed, and agreed upon, before any planning effort is initiated. It will establish what directions are being contemplated, what obstacles and issues have to be dealt with prior to assembling the appropriate combination of experts.</p>
    <p>That requires a highly skilled professional, experienced in a wide range of support disciplines, with the ability to bring the most appropriate resources together to work collaboratively. This Overall Project Coordinator (OPC) must then coordinate the planning exercise, acting as liaison between the SME owner and the experts involved. This requires financial skills, people skills and big picture observation and planning skills. The OPC must make sure that all strategies are executed as planned to ensure success. This is a demanding but highly rewarding endeavour.</p>
    <p>TWMPP™ will be available as a franchise opportunity for a self-starting, take-charge entrepreneur who wants to develop and command his/her own future around an exciting new business model that offers practical solution to the most intriguing and important stage of the Boomer SME saga.</p>
    <p>The money side of Early Stage Planning is also necessary to set the stage necessary to optimize after-tax proceeds of the eventual sale of the business. It will involve professional tax planning that may result in legal corporate restructuring, but it will go much deeper to investigate all aspects of valuation, retirement funding and future financing needs. Incipient Financing™ applicability is considered at this stage.</p>
    <p>Late Stage Planning efforts are targeted to develop and conclude the final details of the business sale, including preparation of final financing arrangements. Every business sale will need Late Stage Planning.</p>
    <p>The more situational Mid-Stage Planning exercise is directed to increasing corporate value prior to the sale. It may involve both internal and external growth oriented planning and strategy execution.</p>
    <p>Permanent Overall Project and Late Stage Coordinator teams will work on every planning engagement. These teams will create an arms-length relationship with at least three experts in each of the 18 different support mandates cited earlier, creating a relatively small network of resources willing to work together on a project-by-project basis. Early enquiry referrals will pass through the coordinators who will qualify interest, arrange the engagement and perform the preliminary scope assessment before assembling expert teams, thus providing constant referrals back to the network.</p>
    <p>These roles are entirely new to succession planning. If this is an opportunity you might wish to further investigate we want to hear from you. Contact us.</p>
