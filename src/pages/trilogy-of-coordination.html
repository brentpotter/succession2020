    <p>TWMPP™ separates the succession planning exercise into three distinctly different phases. Each requires a different level of expertise to participate in the planning and execution stages, and therefore a different level of coordination. Since any given planning project may involve one, two, or all three separate components, the first step is to determine overall scope of the planning engagement.</p>
    <p>Since every business, its owner(s), and its succession needs are different, the entire spectrum of related issues must be evaluated and put into perspective. This will allow a customized planning engagement proposal to be developed, and agreed upon, before assembling the appropriate combination of experts to initiate the planning exercise.</p>
    <p>That requires a highly skilled professional, experienced in a wide range of support disciplines, with the ability to bring the most appropriate resources together to work collaboratively. This Overall Project Coordinator (OPC) must then coordinate the planning exercise, acting as liaison between the SME owner and the experts involved, leaving the owner free to run the business. This requires financial skills, people skills and big picture observation and planning skills. The OPC must make sure that all strategies are executed as planned to ensure success. This is a demanding but highly rewarding endeavour.</p>
    <p>TWMPP™ will be available as a franchise opportunity for  self-starting, take-charge entrepreneurs who want to develop and command his/her own future around an exciting new business model that offers practical solution to the most intriguing and important stage of the Boomer SME saga.</p>
    <p>While Early Stage Planning includes assessment of the “Soft Issues”, its money focus will help set the necessary stage to optimize after-tax proceeds of the eventual sale of the business. That will require professional tax planning that may result in legal corporate restructuring. However, it will go much deeper to investigate all aspects of valuation, retirement funding and future financing needs. Incipient Financing™ applicability is considered at this stage. That necessarily puts a focus on “purpose” in retirement.</p>
    <p>Late Stage Planning efforts are targeted to develop and conclude the final details of the business sale, including preparation of final financing arrangements. Every business sale will need Late Stage Planning.</p>
    <p>The more situationally dependant Mid-Stage Planning exercise is directed to increasing corporate value prior to the sale. It may involve both internal and external growth oriented planning and strategy execution.</p>
    <p>Overall Project and Late Stage Coordinator teams will work on every planning engagement. These teams will create an arms-length relationship with at least three experts in each of the 18 different support mandates cited earlier, creating a relatively small network of resources willing to work together on a project-by-project basis. Early enquiry referrals will pass through the coordinators who will qualify interest, arrange the engagement and perform the preliminary scope assessment before assembling expert teams, thus providing constant referrals back to the network.</p>
    <p>These roles are entirely new to succession planning. If this is an opportunity you might wish to further investigate we want to hear from you.</p> <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>
