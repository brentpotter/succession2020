    <p>If you are a Boomer SME owner who desires a comprehensive business-exit plan into retirement, this website may offer thought provoking insights and practical solutions to get you started.</p>
    <p>You may never be “mentally” ready for retirement, but its inevitability demands financial readiness for a worry-free 15-25 year retirement lifestyle. (See e-Book Excerpts: The Cost of Denial)</p>
    <p>If your business equity is needed to help fund retirement, your primary concern should be converting that equity into cash. That monetization effort requires careful planning around critical succession issues that often need undivided attention. Paradoxically, if you are like most SME owners, you don’t have much time available, or much time remaining, to do this properly. Uncontrollable external forces may dictate your timing. (See e-Book Excerpts: Not Ready? Think Again!)</p>
    <p>Financial and other institutional websites freely list what you can do… but not how to do it!  Interpretations of succession as a do-it-yourself exercise, offer no more than lip-service to SME succession. Invariably, they point to accountants and lawyers for solutions. All SME owners have relationships with these and other support providers, but still, 90% have not yet begun to realistically plan for their business exits.</p>
    <h2>What’s stopping you?</h2>
    First: The obvious disconnect between SME owners and their support providers. Clearly, neither their approach, nor the solutions they offer, has helped you or the 90% of owners like you! (See e-Book Excerpts: Why the Disconnect? - Silos of Expertise - GP/Expert Clash - Outdated Solutions)
    <p>Second: Retirement may be a more feared, than welcomed challenge. If the business, and your role in it, has become a part of your identity, then selling the business threatens who you are. Selling your business can feel like selling your soul. Avoidance is a natural reaction.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the future welcomes only the prepared! The oblivious, in continued denial, will find oblivion! Which do you prefer? Your journey into the future will be… whatever you make it! Every journey begins with a decision, and then commitment… to a plan. Succession planning is the first decisive step of a 3-5 year journey of preparation towards a meaningful and successful retirement. However, before that can begin, a decision is necessary… to take that first step… to take control of your future!</p>
    <p>To ensure success, planning must assess all succession obstacles unique to your business. Each must be clarified, understood and prioritized before they can be properly addressed. That is best done with a coordinated planning process, working with a wide range of expertise, collaboratively focused upon assessing and addressing real needs. Since no such planning process has ever existed, we created one!</p>
