    <p>TWMPP™ interprets Total Wealth as the entire circle of components that produce wealth. It goes beyond the business to encompass the mindset of leadership, vision and entrepreneurship. Wealth is often measured by the accumulation of money. However, the real legacy of wealth transfer is the mindset behind making money. Succession planning efforts must consider Total Wealth.</p>
    <p>There is an old saying that has many variations: Give a man a fish, he will eat well that day. Teach that man to fish, he and his family will never go hungry.</p>
    <p>Successful SME owners have wealth of the mind as well as trapped wealth within a business. TWMPP™ is designed to help monetize both, by helping to ensure that the next generation of SME owner is successful.</p>
    <p>Within that intergenerational transfer endeavour, the seeds of departing owner re-invention and rejuvenation may be found. First you give, then you get. As one door closes another opens. As cliché as this may sound, that is the way life works.</p>
    <p>One aspect of Success(ion), is about creating empty space in one’s life and then re-filling it with something better. A by-product of the TWMPP™ experience is a necessary contemplation of the future, and how one desires to fill that empty space. Re-invention can come naturally, or on demand! However, the main focus of TWMPP™ is to provide a structured, but practical, all-encompassing approach to business succession/sale/exit planning. (See Challenges for Innovative Thinking)</p>
    <p>TWMPP™ separates the business succession planning exercise into three distinctly separate phases each requiring different levels of expertise, and therefore, three different kinds of coordination and leadership. Every business is unique, so each planning effort must be customized. Some SMEs may require only one, or two, of these planning phase efforts. Others may require all three.</p>
    <p>To that end, TWMPP™ employs new professional coordinator roles, within a Trilogy of Coordination that never previously existed.</p> <p>These coordinators are essentially project managers with an incredibly wide range of experience with business succession and the expert roles necessary to address specific issues. No matter which of the three phases are required, TWMPP can accommodate them separately or together, and even overlap them if timeframes are tight.</p>
    <p>These coordinator teams develop a complete upfront assessment of the scope of the planning effort. Once complete, the SME owner will have final say in what is to be included and which experts will be involved. Then using a project management approach, a SWAT team of experts is assembled to deal with each issue in a collaborative format. These experts are selected from a vetted pool of experts who participate as Partners in the Process. When brought together, they offer a highly structured process of issue assessment and access to experts to appropriate address those issues.</p>
